The Subcontractor has requisitioned for the final payment from Contractor pursuant to the above-referenced Contract.

NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration including the payments referenced herein, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Subcontractor agrees as follows:

	1.	The Subcontractor (a) acknowledges receipt equal to the Total Payments Received to Date set forth above, and (b) certifies that: (i) through the date of the above-referenced Final Application for Payment, the amount of said Final Application for Payment, the aggregate of said amounts represents payment in full for all amounts due for all labor performed and materials furnished by the Subcontractor in connection with the Project and the Contract set forth above; (ii) the amounts set forth above are true and correct; (iii) it has no claims for additional costs or claims for any extras or additions for labor and material relating to the Contract or the Project and is not aware of any such claims by any other contractor, subcontractor, sub-subcontractor or materialman; and (iv) Subcontractor and its employees, sub-subcontractors, suppliers and vendors have been paid in full for all labor, services, supplies, equipment and materials furnished in connection with the Contract and the Project.

	2.	The Subcontractor, for itself, its successors and assigns and anyone else acting or claiming by or through it, hereby releases and waives entirely: (a) any mechanic’s lien or other lien, stop notice, or any right against any labor or material payment bond, or claim to any mechanic’s lien or other lien which the Subcontractor may now have for all labor, materials, equipment, services and supplies furnished for use in or performed upon the above-described Premises; (b) any and all claims against Contractor, Owner, Owner’s Lender and the entities listed below and/or its respective related, affiliated and parent persons and entities including, without limitation, the agents, attorneys, employees, heirs, executors, administrators, members, managers, officers, stockholders, partners (both general and limited), sureties, successors, and assigns of the foregoing (collectively referred to as "Released Parties") on account of any action or cause of action which now exists relative to the contracts, labor, materials, equipment, services and supplies referenced above; and (c) releases and forever discharges actions or causes of action, suits, debts, dues, sums of money, accounts, reckonings, bonds, bills, specialties, covenants, promises, variances, trespasses, damages, judgments, extents, executions, claims and demands whatsoever, in law or in equity, which against the Released Parties and any entity providing or administering any construction loan to Owner the Contractor ever had, and now has upon or by reason of any matter, cause, or thing, whatsoever from the beginning of the world to the day this document is executed.

	3.	The Subcontractor further warrants that: (a) all workmen employed by it or its subcontractors upon this Project have been fully paid to the date hereof; (b) all materialmen from whom the Subcontractor or its subcontractors have purchased materials, supplies and/or equipment used in the Project have been fully paid to the date hereof; (c) none of such workmen and materialmen has any claim or demand or right of lien against the above-described Premises; and (d) all applicable taxes, fees and benefits relating directly or indirectly to the Subcontractor’s work have been paid in full.

	4.	The Subcontractor agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Released Parties and any others against whom a claim is asserted by virtue of involvement or relationship with them, from any and all claims, damages, losses, expenses, and the like incurred by reason of any claim that the Subcontractor has not fully paid for all labor, materials and expenses incurred in connection with its work on the Project, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, court or arbitration costs, and expert witness and consultant fees expended in connection with the defense of any such claim.  Subcontractor’s obligations set forth in this Partial Waiver of Lien and Release shall survive termination or completion of the Contract.  Subcontractor acknowledges (a) amounts received from Contractor are trust funds under applicable law and (b) the making and delivery of this Partial Waiver of Lien and Release is a substantial inducement to Contractor in making payments to Subcontractor under the Contract. 

	5.	In addition to its obligations pursuant to the Contract, Subcontractor agrees to pay and/or cause to be discharged within ten (10) calendar days from the date of filing of any and all mechanic’s liens and other liens filed by others against the Project when such liens are claimed to have been filed as a result of the Subcontractor’s failure to make payments for or in connection with any labor, materials, appliances, machinery, equipment, fixtures, or furnishings placed upon or installed in the Project.  After such discharge by bonding, the Subcontractor shall take all steps necessary to effect cancellation, release or satisfaction of the lien.  If Subcontractor fails to comply with the first two sentences of this Paragraph, then any or all of the Released Parties may, at their option: (a) directly settle with lienor and effect a satisfaction of lien, (b) post a bond and discharge such lien, (c) defend any action related to the lien, and/or (d) pay and satisfy any judgment or award in connection with such lien, and the Subcontractor shall be responsible for and pay all of such Released Parties’ direct and indirect costs, including without limitation attorneys’ fees within thirty (30) days from demand therefor.  

	6. 	This Final Unconditional Waiver of Lien and Release does not include any pending claims against the Released Parties asserted by Subcontractor as a result of third-party claims for death or personal injury or property damage arising from or related to Subcontractor’s work.  

	7.	The Subcontractor has not and will not assign any claim against the Released Parties, nor any lien or right to perfect a lien against the Project. The signatory hereof is duly authorized by the Subcontractor to make this affidavit and agrees that the Released Parties and any surety and title insurer may rely upon this waiver and release.	

	8.	Any signature delivered via facsimile or other electronic means, e.g., Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) sent by electronic mail, shall be deemed an original signature hereto. 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Final Unconditional Waiver of Lien and Release has been executed this ____ day of _______________ 2025.
